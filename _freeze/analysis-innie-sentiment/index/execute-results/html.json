I looked at the first two episodes of season two, the first, which consists of just time with the innies, and the second with the outies. I was interested in the difference in sentiment, using [the sentiment lexicon compiled by Bing Liu and collaborators](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/reference/sentiments.html). I calculated a sentiment score by taking the positive - negative scores, higher scores indicate the episode was more positive. It looks like the innies are `TWO TIMES` more positive, in terms of language, compared to the outies. wow.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: text\n\nNow lets look at some word frequency by episode.
