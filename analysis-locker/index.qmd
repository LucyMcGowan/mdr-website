## Mark's locker

We have been curating a database of the contents of Mark's locker and would like to point out the first observed anomoly: in season 1 episode 1, we see Mark's innie watch inside his locker, set around 9:03:20 but interestingly the second hand is fixed! It isn't ticking. He swaps this for his outie watch, set at 9:05 (with the day marked the 4th). When he returns at the end of the day the innie watch is now 5:25 (as is the outie watch, althought interestingly the date is now the fifth?); the second hand still isn't moving UNTIL he places his new badge in the locker, then it begins to move.
