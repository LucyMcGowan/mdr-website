The data consists of all elevator dings in the Severance episodes along with the episode number, time stamp, pitch of the ding, and the action associated. Examining the plot below, we see across all dings the G is associated with both innie and outies going to sleep, the C# is consistently associated with both innies and outies waking up, and in general a Bb plays when they enter the elevator, however there are a few B♮ thrown in there at the beginning of episode 5."

I looked at the first two episodes of season two, the first, which consists of just time with the innies, and the second with the outies. I was interested in the difference in sentiment, using the sentiment lexicon compiled by Bing Liu and collaborators. I calculated a sentiment score by taking the positive - negative scores, higher scores indicate the episode was more positive. It looks like the innies are TWO TIMES more positive, in terms of language, compared to the outies. wow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets look at some word frequency by episode. I pulled out the top 5 words per sentiment (and show some ties).\n\n\n\nSelecting by n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting by n"
