The data consists of all elevator dings in the Severance episodes along with the episode number, time stamp, pitch of the ding, and the action associated. Examining the plot below, we see across all dings the G is associated with both innie and outies going to sleep, the C# is consistently associated with both innies and outies waking up, and in general a Bb plays when they enter the elevator, however there are a few B♮ thrown in there at the beginning of episode 5."

I was interested in the difference in sentiment, using the AFINN sentiment lexicon. It looks like the innies are far more negative, in terms of language, compared to the outies, with the innies having a negative average sentiment score (-0.26) and the outies a positive score (0.26).
